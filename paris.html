Bonjour Mon Ami! Paris needs no formal introduction - synonymous with culture, architecture, food and fashion. That je ne sais quoi of the French capital makes it the dream destination for many. So would you want to leave Paris 'Before Sunset' or would you take our word and spend a 'Midnight in Paris'?!

One of the greatest art repositories in the world, harbouring artistic pedigree in the likes of Renoir, Rodin, Picasso, Monet and Van Gogh. The magnificent Louvre, exceptional impressionist collections and the Centre Pompidou's modern and contemporary art, a plethora of smaller museums showcasing collections in every genre imaginable. The mesmerizing wrought-iron spire of the Eiffel Tower piercing the skyline, the Arc de Triomphe guarding the most glamorous avenue, the Champs-Élysées, the regal Notre Dame cathedral, lamp lit bridges spanning the Seine and art nouveau cafes spilling on to wicker-chair-lined terraces. At the forefront of international trends, chic designer boutiques, vintage shops, flagship haute couture stores and flea markets - redefining style, elegance and class. Exquisite French cuisine, enticing patisseries and boulangeries (bakeries), luscious fromageries (cheese shops), fragrant wine shops. Bohemian Montmarte, trendy Marais. Tree lined boulevards, prolific green parks and of course the grand Seine. Wine and cheese. One word to describe all of the above - Paris.
